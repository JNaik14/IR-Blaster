# IR-Blaster

The csv file is a list of ir codes in raw format, for tv,ac,etc.

# WTFMONITR

The wtfmonitr* files are the code i wrote to find the ir codes of buttons of my monitor as i coundln't find any spare remote and had to make it myself.
Arduino UNO, IR-LED and a PC was enough to get the job done.
